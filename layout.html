        <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly unlikely to acquire Atlanta Hawks guard Dejounte Murray ahead of
            Thursday's trade deadline.</p>

        <p>ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on The Hoop Collective (58-minute mark) that talks between the Lakers and Hawks
            have been "pretty cold" as the deadline approaches.</p>

        <p>The Lakers have been the team most often linked to Murray as the disappointing Hawks look to retool their
            roster. Atlanta has been asking for two first-round picks in trade talks. The Lakers can only trade their
            2029 first-round pick due to the Stepien Rule, which has presented a roadblock in trade talks.</p>

        <p>While it's likely the Lakers would part ways with that pick to land Murray, the remainder of their assets are
            not particularly promising. Austin Reaves has been made borderline untouchable in trade talks, leaving the
            Lakers to offer D'Angelo Russell as the centerpiece of any deal.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Trade LeBron</li>

            <li>Trade Ar-15</li>
            <p>Murray would be a home run acquisition for the Lakers and frankly most teams around the league. It's a
                little confusing why the Hawks would even look to move on. Murray hides Young's weakness on the
                defensive end by guarding the opposing team's best ball-handler, and he works as a stellar secondary
                ball-handler and floor spacer himself.</p>
